\title{Packet Construction Set: A New Approach to Network Protocol
  Construction, Testing and Interrogation}
\author{Paper \#22}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
Network protocol design, construction and testing has always been
hampered by the lack of a natural way in which to express packets as
source code.  The majority of network protocol software is written in
low level languages and is contained within operating systems
kernels.  While such implementations make sense for highly optimized
systems they are not the best approach for developing new or
experimental protocols, nor are they required for protocol conformance
tests, and other types of tools.

The Protocol Construction Set (PCS) is a new approach to writing
network protocol code that makes building new protocols, and new
protocol tools, easier and less error prone.  PCS's two key features
are a simple and clean representation of packets and packet fields in
source code, and the promotion of packets to high level language
objects that are easier to create and manipulate within programs.  In
this paper we present our completed system, both design and
implementation, as well as several tools that have been built using
it, including the Packet Debugger, a program for working with network
packets in the same way in which programmers use source code
debuggers.

\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

The way in which network protocols are written has been little changed
since the first versions of the ARPANet protocol~\cite{} were built in
the early 1970s.  At that time it was necessary to write network
protocols in a low level language, often assemlber, and then later C,
and to place the protocol code into the core of the operating system
\cite{}.  In order to verify the proper functioning of the protocol
test code might be written, but more commonly two copies of the same
code were run against each other to make sure that the systems could
``talk'' to each other without error.  Experimenting with, and writing
new, protocols often required putting the protocol code into an
operating system kernel because that was the only way in which to get
ahold of the necessary low level software and hardware facilities to
affet communication.  Although a protocol could be built and run
outside the kernel, where better tools might make the job eaiser, this
has always required porting the in kernel facilities into libraries
that can be used by user level programs.  To this day most people
develop their protocols in the kernel, where the tools for debugging
and working with code are at their bare minimum.  Being built in low
level languages, protocols have always had to do their own low level
manipulation of packet data as well as express the logic of the
protocol machinery, often leading to confusing and hard to read code.

The Packet Construction Set (PCS) is a set of language extensions that
make writing protocol code more natural and less error prone, allowing
for faster development and easier experimentation with network
protocols.  The two key features of PCS are the ability to easily
translate a packet format into a an object in the language, and the
provision of easy access to the fields of a packet as attributes of
the generated object.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows, in
Section~\ref{sec:the-programmers-view} we present how a protocol
designer, implementor, or tester uses PCS.
Section~\ref{sec:a-concrete-example} gives a concrete example of a
system built using PCS to work with several well known protocols,
including IPv4\cite{rfc791}, IPv6\cite{rfc2460} and Ethernet \cite{}.

\section{The Programmer's View}
\label{sec:the-programmers-view}

The focus in PCS is on the programmer and it is for them that the
system was built.  To most programmers the part of buiding a network
protocol that is tedious is the need to manipulate low level
structures, which require proper alignment, and byte ordering in order
for the protocol to work at all.  Take, for example, an IPv4 packet,
seen in Figure\ref{fig:rfc791-ipheader}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\label{fig:rfc791-ipheader}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{IPv4Packet}
  \caption{IPv4 Header Format}
\end{figure}

IPv4 was designed in the late 1970s and first deployed in the early
1980s, when byte addressable machines were popular, computer networks
were slower and computer memory sizes were much smaller than they were
today.  In order to pack enough information into the header to make it
easy and fast to transmit the designers attempted to not waste space,
and used fields that were as efficient as they could make them.  The
IPv4 header contains 3 fields that are less than a byte in length,
including the \verb|version|, \verb|header length|, and \verb|flags.|
Though these choices meant that little space was wasted they also
require some complex gymnastics from the programmer implementing the
protocol.  Due to the fact that the \verb|flags| field is only 3 bits
in length, the \verb|Fragement Offset| starts in the middle of a
byte.  The \verb|version| and \verb|header length|, are each sub byte
quantities, which are not naturally addressable in the language in
which most IP protocol stacks are written, C.

In order to overcome these limitations programmers have written
special macros to handle getting data into and out of the fields of
the packet, and to make sure that the bytes that are placed into the
packet are in the correct byte order for the network.  These
constraints lead to code, such as that in
Figure~\ref{fig:c-structure-for-an-ipv4-packet} from the FreeBSD
Operating System Kernel \cite{McKusick}, for representing IP packets

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
struct ip {
#if BYTE_ORDER == LITTLE_ENDIAN
	u_int	ip_hl:4,		/* header length */
		ip_v:4;			/* version */
#endif
#if BYTE_ORDER == BIG_ENDIAN
	u_int	ip_v:4,			/* version */
		ip_hl:4;		/* header length */
#endif
	u_char	ip_tos;			/* type of service */
	u_short	ip_len;			/* total length */
	u_short	ip_id;			/* identification */
	u_short	ip_off;			/* fragment offset field */
#define	IP_RF 0x8000			/* reserved fragment flag */
#define	IP_DF 0x4000			/* dont fragment flag */
#define	IP_MF 0x2000			/* more fragments flag */
#define	IP_OFFMASK 0x1fff		/* mask for fragmenting bits */
	u_char	ip_ttl;			/* time to live */
	u_char	ip_p;			/* protocol */
	u_short	ip_sum;			/* checksum */
	struct	in_addr ip_src,ip_dst;	/* source and dest address */
} __packed __aligned(4);
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{C Structure for an IPv4 Packet}
  \label{fig:c-structure-for-an-ipv4-packet}
\end{figure}

In order to access the flags field in a packet, which is not visibly
represented in this structure, the programmer needs to mask off bites
of the offset field \verb|ip_off|, or offset, field, as can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:accessing-the-flags-field}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
if (ip->ip_off & (IP_MF | IP_OFFMASK)) {  
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Accessing the flags field in an IPv4 packet}
  \label{fig:accessing-the-flags-field}
\end{figure}

While the preceeding code may seem reasonable and a common idiom to an
operating system kernel programmer it is not so for most other
programmers, for many people building new protocols, or for people
writing test code.  In many cases such code is not even necessary to
the task.

\subsection{PCS and Packets}
\label{sec:pcs-and-packets}

In PCS packets are transformed into objects in the Python language
\cite{vanRossum}, and their fields appear as attributes of the
object.  Each packet has two simultaneous representations, as a set of
bytes as they would be transmitted on the wire, and as a set of
attributes of an object, as used by programs writtien in the Python
language.

Accessing a field returns the value contained in the bytes of the
packet, and assigning a value to a field updates the bytes of the
packet.  The bytes of the packet and the values of the associated
attributes are kept in sync at all times during program execution,
which allows the programmer to ignore how the bytes are stored and
transmitted on the wire and to concentrate on the way the protocol
uses the fields of a packet.  All fields of the packet implement
bounds checking at run time, so any attempt to write a value that is
too large into the object is raised as an exception.  

Throughout the rest of this section we shall use the IPv4 packet as
our example, for all the reasons stated in
Section~\ref{sec:the-programmers-view} relating to the packet's
inherent complexity.  The code that describes the fields of an IPv4
packet in PCS is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ipv4-packet-in-pcs} and the
full class definition can be found in the source code\cite{}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
version = pcs.Field("version", 4, default = 4)
hlen = pcs.Field("hlen", 4)
tos = pcs.Field("tos", 8)
length = pcs.Field("length", 16)
id = pcs.Field("id", 16)
flags = pcs.Field("flags", 3)
offset = pcs.Field("offset", 13)
ttl = pcs.Field("ttl", 8, default = 64)
protocol = pcs.Field("protocol", 8)
checksum = pcs.Field("checksum", 16)
src = pcs.Field("src", 32)
dst = pcs.Field("dst", 32)
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{The fields of an IPv4 packet in PCS}
  \label{fig:ipv4-packet-in-pcs}
\end{figure}

A \class{Packet} is a class defined by the PCS module, and all packets
defined in the system inherit from this base class.  In order to
define a field in a packet to be an attribute of an object, a
\class{Field} class is used.  The \class{Field} class can take three
arguments in its constructor.  The first argument is a \verb|name|,
which will become the name of the attribute in the object that we use
to manipulate that particular set of bits in the packet.  How that is
exploited will be covered in the next paragraphs.  The second argument
is a \verb|width|, in bits, for the field.  The \verb|width| for a
simple field can be from 1 to 32 bits.  Other types of \class{Fields}
are provided to encode strings and length/value encoded strings into
packet, but they are beyond the scope of the present discussion.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
pcs.Packet.__init__(self,
   [version, hlen, tos, length, id, flags, 
    offset, ttl, protocol, checksum, src, dst],
   bytes = bytes)
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Initializing the packet object}
  \label{fig:initializing-the-packet-object}
\end{figure}

Defining the fields in the packet is the first step in setting up a
packet object.  Once the fields are defined we must call the base
class's constructor, in Python it's \verb|__init__()| method, in order
to finishing setting up the object.  It is in the base class's
\verb|__init__()| method that the object is given the attributes we
have defined in Figure~\ref{fig:ipv4-packet-in-pcs}.  The second
argument is a list containing the fields we just defined, \emph{in the order
in which they are to appear in the packet.}  The last argument,
\field{bytes} is used when the caller has a set of bytes from the
network that they wish to convert into an object, and its use will be
seen in Section~\ref{}.  

The ordering shown in the second argument is very important, because
it is this ordering that determines the way in which the fields will
be put into the underlying bytes of the packet.  The code shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:initializing-the-packet-object} exactly follows the
IPv4 packet layout shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rfc791-ipheader}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
>>> from pcs.packets.ipv4 import ipv4
>>> ip = ipv4()
>>> print ip
IPv4
version 4
hlen 0
tos 0
length 0
id 0
flags 0
offset 0
ttl 64
protocol 0
checksum 0
src 0.0.0.0
dst 0.0.0.0

>>> print ip.bytes
^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
>>> ip.hlen=5
>>> ip.ttl=32
>>> print ip.bytes
E^@^@^@^@^@^@^@ ^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Interactive manipulation of an IPv4 object}
  \label{fig:interactive-manipulation-of-an-ipv4-object}
\end{figure}

With the packet so defined we can now use it in a program or work with
it interactively in the Python command line interpreter.
Figure~\ref{fig:interactive-manipulation-of-an-ipv4-object} shows the
creation of an IPv4 object from its class, and what happens when we
read or write the attributes of the object.  The \verb|bytes| field of
every \class{Packet} object contains the up to date set of bytes for
the packet as they would be transmitted on the wire, and is not meant
to be printed or read by humans.  In this case it is instructive
because it shows, in its first and eighth locations the changes that
have been effected by changing the values of the attributes in the
IPv4 object.

\subsection{Run Time Boundary Checking}
\label{sec:run-time-boundary-checking}

In PCS, each field knows its size and so run time boundary checks are
implemented when a programmer sets a field of a packet.  Whenever a
program attempts to store a value that is too large for a field into a
packet an exception is raised, which can be caught and handled by a
program, or, when not caught, will result in the program halting.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
>>> ip.ttl = 65535
Traceback (most recent call last):
[debugging information deleted]
pcs.FieldBoundsError: 
    'Value must be between 0 and 255'
>>> 
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Run Time Boundary Checking}
  \label{fig:run-time-boundary-checking}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:run-time-boundary-checking} we have attempted to
assign a 16 bit value to the time to live, \verb|ttl|, field, which is
only 8 bits wide.  Boundary checking is enabled on all fields.

\subsection{Unpacking Layers of Packets}
\label{sec:unpacking-layers-of-packets}

All network protocols support layering, the ability to put one packet
into the payload of another.  The canonical example is a TCP segment
encapsulated within an IPv4 packet which is carried within an Ethernet
frame.  In PCS each packet class knows how to decode the packets that
could likely occur in its payload.  Each packet class has a
\field{data} attribute and a \method{next} method.  The \field{data}
attribute contains an object reference to the next higher layer packet
contained in the packet object, and the \method{next} method 
calls the appropriate constructor to fill in the \field{data}
attribute.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
def next(self, bytes):
    if self.type == ETHERTYPE_ARP:
        return arp(bytes)
    if self.type == ETHERTYPE_IP:
        return ipv4(bytes)
    if self.type == ETHERTYPE_IPV6:
        return ipv6(bytes)
    return None
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{The Ethernet Class's \method{next} method}
  \label{fig:ethernet-next-method}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ethernet-next-method} shows the code from the
\class{Ethernet} class which unpacks the protocols that can be
supported in its payload.  At the moment the \class{Ethernet} class
can support the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), IPv4 and IPv6.
Note that the return value from the \method{next} method is an object
from the appropriate class for the payload found in the Ethernet packet.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
if (bytes != None):
    self.data = self.next(bytes[etherlen:len(bytes)])
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{Calling the \method{next} method during object construction}
  \label{fig:calling-next-method}
\end{figure}

Each packet class uses its \method{next} method to fill in its
\field{data} attribute when its constructor,
i.e. \method{\_\_init\_\_} method is called with packet data.
Figure~\ref{fig:calling-next-method} shows the code in the
\class{Ethernet} class's constructor which receives the object created
by the \method{next} method.  Packet objects are tied together via
their \field{data} attributes, with the highest level attribute being
a \class{Payload} class.  The \class{Payload} class acts as a catch
all packet class which terminates a string of packets, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:data-field-chain}.

\begin{figure}

\label{fig:data-field-chain}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{DataFieldChain}
  \caption{Using the data field to chain packets}
\end{figure}

\section{Support for reading and writing packets}
\label{sec:support-for-reading-and-writing}

So far we have described only the way in which packet classes and
packet objects are implemented and manipulated within \program{PCS}.
For the system to be useful to a programmer it must also support the
ability to read and write data into and out of packet objects.
\program{PCS} supports access to many types of network services
including the well known \program{socket} library as well as directly
to network interfaces using the \program{pcap} packet capture
facility.  Live capture and injection are supported as well as the
reading and writing of pre-recorded dump files, such as those created
with \program{tcpdump}\cite{}.

Within \program{PCS} a special set of classes exist, collectively
known as \class{Connectors}.  Each connector is of a specific type for
accessing a socket, network interface or dump file.  For example the
\class{PcapConnector} can open, read, and write a network interface or
a pre-recorded dump file, wherease a \class{TCPConnector} gives access
a more traditional TCP socket.  Each connector class implements their
own versions of the \method{read}, \method{write}, \method{send},
\method{recv}, \method{sendmsg}, and \method{recvfrom} and
\method{readpkt} methods.  In all the connector classes it is the
\method{readpkt} method that is used most often because it not only
gets the packet from the underlying socket or file but returns a
proper object to the caller, as opposed to a string of bytes which
much subsequently be passed to the correct packet class's constructor
method.

The implementation of the \class{PcapConnector} class's
\method{readkpkt} and \method{unpack} methods give a clear
demonstration of the power of \program{PCS} for user programs.  The
code for both functions is shown, combined, in
Figure~\ref{fig:readpkt-and-unpack-code}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
\begin{verbatim}
[readpkt() code]

packet = self.file.next()[1]
return self.unpack(packet, self.dlink, 
                   self.dloff)

[... and now unpack() ...]

if dlink == pcap.DLT_EN10MB:
    return packets.ethernet.ethernet(packet)
elif dlink == pcap.DLT_NULL:
    return packets.localhost.localhost(packet)
else:
    raise UnpackError, 
        "Could not interpret packet"
\end{verbatim}
  \caption{readpkt and unpack method code}
  \label{fig:readpkt-and-unpack-code}
\end{figure}

The \method{readpkt} method actually knows nothing about packets, it
only knows about the underlying interface, a pcap connection to a
network interface or file.  The \method{unpack} method is what maps a
datalink type, such as Ethernet or Localhost (also known as the
loopback interface) to a packet type and attempts to construct the
proper packet chain for each packet read from the file or the wire.
Successive calls of the \method{next} method in each object correctly
created will cause an entire chain of packets to be returned to the
caller.  Visualizing the packet chain will be easier when we give a
concrete example in Section~\ref{sec:a-concrete-example}.

Writing, or injecting, packets into a file or the network is handled
more simply because each packet already has within it the proper set
of bytes to write to the file or network interface.  Each connector
class need only implement a \method{write} method, which takes as its
arguments the set of bytes and the length of the bytes, in order to
properly output the packet.

\section{A Concrete Example}
\label{sec:a-concrete-example}

The best way to show the power of \program{PCS} is to show it being
used in a real program.  The Packet Debugger (\program{pdb} is a
program which works with packet capture files, those read and written
with the \program{pcap} library\cite{}, as if they are lines of source
code.  With \program{pdb} a user can load, manipulate, edit and replay
\program{pcap} files in order to debug their network protocol, or any
other network based software.  The \program{pdb} program uses all of
the previously decribed features of \program{PCS} to achieve these
goals in less than 1000 lines of code.
