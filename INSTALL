Installation Instructions for Packet Construction Set (PCS)

PCS follows the normal Python conventions for building and installing
and there is very little, if any, magic.  To install the library and
the associated packet classes into your system do:

> python setup.py install <return>

To test your installation do:

> cd tests/ <return>
> python *.py

Some tests fail if you do not have enough privileges to work with the
Berkeley Packet Filter.  If you wish to run those tests run them
using sudo.

To build the documentation you will need pdflatex and a BSD version of
make(1) installed.  Go into the docs directory and build the
documentation:

> cd docs/ <return>
> bsdmake all

you will see PDF versions of the docs.
